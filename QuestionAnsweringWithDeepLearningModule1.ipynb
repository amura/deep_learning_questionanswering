It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.” (UNFAO, \\n2019)19. In the context of the Taxonomy, plantations forests are specifically excluded.

Specifically \\nincludes: short rotation plantation for wood, fibre and energy; 2 Specifically excludes: forest planted for \\nprotection or ecosystem restoration; 3. Specifically excludes: Forest established through planting or \\nseeding which at stand maturity resembles or will resemble naturally regenerating forest. Recognising \\nthat countries or country groups may set specific definitions of forest to represent specific regional \\nconditions, the Taxonomy allows for the use of forest definitions developed under regional processes, \\nsuch as Forest Europe, and various agreements, such as the International Tropical Timber Agreement \\netc., providing that these are aligned with the FAO definition. When applying to be Taxonomy aligned, the \\nspecific definition (if different from FAO) should be set out and the alignment with FAO definition \\ndemonstrated clearly.

Respecting the \\ncommercial function of many forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. \\nHowever, providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annual \\nincrement, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time.

This is for the pragmatic reason that \\nmany forest managers and owners do not know in which supply chains their products will arise. In \\nprinciple however, the Taxonomy recognises the holistic mitigation potential of forests and wood \\nbeyond the forest gate both through the effect of substitution (replacing more GHG intensive \\nmaterials) and through the long-term carbon sink potential of wood products. Furthermore, the forest \\nTaxonomy deals with the production and supply of forest biomass, but not the demand or end use of \\nthat biomass. The relationship between the end use of biomass and its production, i.e. market pull, is \\nan important component of the overall sustainable finance Taxonomy to consider when incentivising \\ndifferent NACE sectors towards substantial contribution to mitigation. At present climate benefits \\nbeyond the forest gate are expected to be captured through the construction/building, energy and \\nmanufacturing sector Taxonomies, and thus create an incentive for the use of wood in the economy, \\nand thus the management of forests in compliance with the Taxonomy. The Platform should therefore \\nimprove the holistic consideration of forests’ (and forest products) mitigation potential across their \\nentire value chains, and across all sectors of the economy, including end of life.

Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article \\n29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the \\ncompliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, \\nhowever through a verification process.

The principles of \\nthe circular economy look towards the designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials \\nin use, and regenerating natural systems. Therefore, forest-based products that have already been used \\nwithin an economic sector other than forestry should become part of the circular economy and contribute \\nin another sector – with the aim to keep the wood in its material form for as long as possible before \\ndisposal and/or energy recovery. This follows the principle of resource efficiency (EU Forest Strategy \\ndescribed it as: using forest resources in a way that minimises the impact on the environment and \\nclimate, and prioritising the forest outputs that have higher added-value, create more jobs and contribute \\nto a better carbon balance). This raises a key question as to the point at which the forest-based sector \\nwould be recognised for the initial material production (as a means of substantial contribution), and to \\ncontribute to substitution in multiple sectors (where the same wood is used) for their decarbonisation.

The logic of the taxonomy overall \\nsuggests that this should still be in the sector that takes the raw material and processes it into something \\nwhich will deliver substitution, or utilises that material (or energy) in substitute for another. It would seem \\ninappropriate to recognise the felling of trees, i.e. the provision of the raw material as an enabling activity \\nper se.

', 'Ideas on a possible enabling approach ', 'Within the manufacturing TEG, the Taxonomy already recognises enabling activities. These are \\nrecognised on the basis of the principal of “The manufacture of low carbon technologies that result in \\nsubstantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy (including private households) is \\neligible.” It is therefore the production of something that would lead to substantial GHG emission \\nreductions in other sectors. In this context, components of renewable energy infrastructure are cited, \\namongst others. The line between the manufacture of an essential product for decarbonisation and \\nsubstantial mitigation, is clear. Forest products are slightly different. Wood materials and energy are not \\nnecessarily essential components of low-carbon technology, in that a house or furniture is not necessarily \\nlow-carbon if it is made from wood. The key identifying feature for wood products is one of substitution, \\nwhether another low(er)-carbon product could be used or whether there are other forms of energy (or \\ndemand reduction) that would be more carbon beneficial. Therefore, the logical link for ‘greening by’ of \\nthe forest sector would need to be able to demonstrate something like the following criteria:  ', '•  The product that has been substituted was essential to the low-carbon performance of the sector in ', 'which it is used ', '•  The product that has been substituted was of a higher GHG/carbon intensity than the substitute ', 'woody biomass (Thresholds could be proposed] ', '•  That primary manufacturing was necessary and could not have been substituted from the recovery ', 'and re-use or recycling of existing products, including wood-based products.

', 'In light of the design of the overall Taxonomy (activity based) and the fact that the substitution effect can \\nonly be judged in an end-use sector (i.e. at the product level) it is challenging to produce a ‘greening by’ \\napproach that can be implemented through the forest Taxonomy alone. As such, it is proposed that the \\n‘greening of’ through the use of forest products, is addressed through those sectors that utilise those \\nforest products (i.e. end use or intermediary sectors), such as manufacturing or buildings. Specific \\nrecommendations to other Taxonomy sectors (Buildings and Manufacturing) are made in the preamble to \\nthe forest Taxonomy, and not repeated here. These can be summarised as follows:  ', '•  The development of reliable thresholds for carbon emission embodied in activities utilising wood.

AGRICULTURE  ', 'Why agriculture is addressed in the Taxonomy ', 'Agriculture is the management of the natural environment, plants and animals to produce and process \\nfood, feed, fibre, fuel and other products. As a sector, it plays a central role in climate change, sustainable \\ndevelopment and food security. It is projected that by 2050 the global population will increase to 10 billion, \\nresulting in a 50% increase in the demand for food. However, even at present, the food supply chain \\ncontributes 19-29% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the majority of which, for most supply \\nchains, occurs at the farm level (80-90%). In the EU, 10% of GHG emissions are attributed to \\nagriculture.124 This alone presents opportunities for significant climate change mitigation. However, \\nagriculture differs from other sectors when considering climate change mitigation as it can act as both a \\nsource and a sink for GHG emissions. Soil carbon and biomass (trees, shrubs and grasslands) are also \\nrelevant as major pools of carbon. For this reason, agriculture has the potential to be a net positive sector \\nfrom an emissions perspective. At the same time, agricultural productivity is simultaneously vulnerable to \\nclimate change (including, but not limited to, heat stress, drought, flooding, changes in seasonality and \\nextreme weather events) and central to supporting adaptation and resilience through its provision of \\necosystem services and income for billions of households worldwide. ', 'Subjects covered  ', 'The following economic activities are explicitly addressed in the Taxonomy: ', '•  Growing of non-perennials: including cereals, rice, leguminous crops and oil seeds, vegetables, ', 'melons, roots and tubers, sugar cane and fibre crops;  ', '•  Growing of perennials: including grapes, tropical and sub-tropical fruits, citrus fruits, stone fruits, ', 'other tree and bush fruits and nuts, oleaginous fruits, beverage crops, spices, aromatics and drug \\nand pharmaceutical crops, grass leys; ', '•  Animal production: including dairy and other cattle and buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry ', 'and the management of their waste (manure) and related grassland or pasture. ', 'In addition, mixed farming, where combinations of the above activities are carried out on a farm holding, \\ncan be addressed via the application of the relevant thresholds and criteria from these same three \\nactivities. For the purpose of the Taxonomy, mixed farming involves any operation with both livestock and \\ncrop production. Crops grown in mixed farming can be grown either to feed livestock or for separate sale \\nas a cash crop. In assessing mixed farming operations, cropland production should be screened using \\ncriteria for growing of non-perennials (e.g. if vineyards or orchards are included) or perennial crops (e.g. if \\na farm grows cereals). Livestock production should be assessed according to the animal production \\ncriteria. It is important to note that recoupling of crops and livestock can lead to greater resource \\nefficiency and reduced reliance on synthetic inputs, thus improving climate and environmental ', '124 2015 figure taken from  ', ' ', 'https://www.ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Archive:Agri \\nenvironmental_indicator_greenhouse_gas_emissions ', ' ', ' ', '-  102 - ', '\\x0c ', 'performance125. At the same time, if accompanied by productivity improvement on existing agricultural \\nlands, mixed farming reduces the expansion pressures of agriculture into non cultivated/used land.

', 'Setting criteria and thresholds ', 'As noted above, agriculture can act as both a source and a sink for GHG emissions. However, it may not \\nbe possible to reach net negative emissions in every instance of agricultural activity or on every farm, \\nparticularly those that are specialised in nature and/or have low carbon stocking capacity. Therefore, the \\nTaxonomy does not require the demonstration of net negative emissions at the activity or farm level, but \\ninstead requires that the following three criteria must all be met for agricultural activities to be recognised \\nas delivering substantial contributions to mitigation:  ', '1.  Reduced emissions from ongoing land and animal management.  ', '2.

', 'The lack of deep GHG reporting datasets from which to establish best performance benchmarks, coupled \\nwith the lack of emissions budgets or sequestration targets for the agricultural sector at either the EU or \\nglobal level, meant it was not possible to set robust absolute GHG thresholds for either criteria 1 or 2. \\nFurthermore, given the high degree of heterogeneity across the agricultural sector (in terms of production \\nsystem, crop or livestock type, farm size, environmental and biophysical conditions, etc.), it was felt to be \\ninappropriate to do so.  ', 'However, requiring a relative GHG improvement compared to an ‘own-farm counterfactual’ is workable \\nwithin this context of high heterogeneity. For criteria 1, emissions reductions targets as a percentage of \\nthat counterfactual have been established using studies of the emissions reductions needed across the \\nagricultural sector as whole over time. For criteria 2, recognising that carbon stocking potential is highly \\nvariable across different land parcels, but that carbon sequestration represents a large mitigation potential \\navailable to the agriculture sector, a simpler requirement has been set – simply that carbon stocks are \\nincreased over a 20-year period – which recognises that preventing ongoing carbon losses and \\nincreasing sequestration is viable to make a substantial contribution in this case. It is noted, however, that \\nthe studies on emissions reduction paths are limited in number and therefore the criteria would benefit \\nfrom greater clarity on the precise transition needed in the agriculture sector to contribute to a net-zero \\neconomy in 2050.

The Taxonomy is set up to ensure that, for economic activities that are compliant with the \\nTaxonomy, a substantial contribution to mitigation in the agriculture sector, does not come at the expense \\nof significant harm to the other five  environmental objectives. However, the interrelated nature of these \\nenvironmental goals actually offers the opportunity to develop substantial mitigation approaches that not \\nonly do no harm to other Taxonomy objectives but also deliver or enable positive contributions to other \\nTaxonomy objectives.  ', 'For these reasons, climate mitigation cannot, should not, and has not been, considered in isolation from \\nthe other five environmental objectives of the Taxonomy. Many of the measures included in the best-\\npractice tables for substantial contribution to mitigation criteria are agro-ecological practices or nature-\\nbased land management activities (e.g. crop rotation, planting hedges), which are win-win or no-regret \\nmeasures. While they contribute substantially to climate mitigation, they also have significant benefits for \\nsoil health, biodiversity, resource efficiency and water protection and thereby increase resilience against \\nclimatic extremes. In other cases, the synergies with other objectives need to be more carefully pursued \\nand considerations made that are often context-specific.

This has in part been pursued so as to prevent system lock-in whereby an \\nimmediate action for mitigation prevents or closes down future options for change that could deliver \\ngreater mitigation benefits in the sector. For example, the investment in activities that seek to improve the \\nGHG performance of the livestock sector should not prevent more systemic changes in the sector \\nthrough, for example, greater integration of livestock and crop production (mixed farming), or overall \\nreduction in livestock production. Another example can be taken from the perspective of the use and \\nproduction of biofuels for the transport sector. Whilst more sustainable liquid biofuels have allowed GHG \\nemission reductions from transport energy, they perpetuate the use of internal combustion engines in a \\nmitigation development trajectory that may seek more substantial changes, such as electrification of \\nvehicles, or modal shift.

As this \\napproach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will \\nadditional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of farms (and associated assets ', '118 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', ' ', 'and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint. As such, it avoids the \\nproblems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above.  ', 'Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: enteric \\nfermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); and \\nmanure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e) (2014 figures). Mitigation potential therefore \\npredominantly involves reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture \\nemissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only \\n0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU’s agricultural non-\\nCO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous \\noxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application and \\nexposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely \\nfrom livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating, \\ncooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm.  The proposed \\nbest practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than \\n20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy source \\nrequirements.  ', 'In respect of perennial cropland production, key sources of emissions are emissions associated with \\nsoil management and the application of fertilisers, and emissions embedded in post-harvest waste.

These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range of \\nbiophysical and farming conditions. ', 'Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices and also \\nindicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantial \\nmitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentally \\nsustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however, provides limited guidance \\non  how  to  translate  sectoral  or  activity-based  mitigation  potential  into  individual  farm-level  mitigation \\npotential, i.e.  what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level in \\ndifferent conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEG expert input was used to determine \\nthe  minimum  combination  of  practices  which  should  be  applied  together  for  perennial  cropland \\nmanagement to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.

It is noted that given \\nheterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions \\nimpacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial \\nmitigation in the majority of cases.  The applicable area for management practices relates to where \\nthose practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, \\nbuffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and \\nditches, etc. Therefore, some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they \\nadd value.  ', 'One best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced \\nemissions or increased sequestration.  The rationale for including this practice is to raise awareness of \\nwhere  the  main  emission  sources  are  on  a  farm  holding,  what  opportunities  exist  to  reduce  those \\nemissions and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunities \\nfor carbon sinks, and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification or \\naudit  of  the  assessment  is  required  to  fulfil  this  best  practice  requirement.  This  is  different  from  the \\nquantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, both of which are necessary when  demonstrating \\ncompliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds.

If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently \\naccessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory \\nsupport),  this  practice  may  be  omitted  in  the  first  instance.  The  assessment,  however,  becomes \\nmandatory within a five year period,   ', 'On GHG emission reduction thresholds ', 'Substantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net -\\nnegative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to \\nvarying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions \\nfrom the agriculture sector as a whole or perennial crop production specifically the degree to which \\nemission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It is \\nalso noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should be \\nconsistent in the global context.  ', '120 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', 'A review by Wollenberg et al, 2016143 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between \\n0.9 – 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 °C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as an \\napproximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are “an annualized”, not \\ncumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15–7.78 GtCO2e yr-1 for \\nagriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11–18% reduction relative to the scenarios’ respective \\n2030 business as usual baselines”144. As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions, they implicitly do \\nnot recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals. \\nAs such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has \\nbeen proposed as ‘significant contribution’ in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by work \\nfrom Frank et al (2018)145, and The IPCC’s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007)146. ', 'In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al \\n(2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to \\n2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points, \\nrelative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figure \\nneeded over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we move \\ntowards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications for \\nany threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger \\n(approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear \\nbetween the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by \\n2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifies \\nimplementation and communication. ', 'The study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture. However, \\nestablishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation \\neffectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was \\nnot in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare \\nemissions at the start of period with those achieved in 10 years-time and assess this against the target \\nreduction.  ', 'The threshold metric for emissions reduction is gCO2e, and not an emissions intensity metric such as \\ngCO2e/ unit of production, as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions \\nintensity (e.g. through energy or resource efficiency) while also requiring them to reduce emissions \\noverall – the overall goal.

Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of \\nemissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction over 10 years for example can be expected to \\ndeliver a ‘substantial’ contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission \\nreductions). However, the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural \\nland as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock \\nincrease would be needed on agricultural land in a 1.5 or 2°C climate stabilisation target scenario, as \\nthis is relative to the level of emissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or \\nthe level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy.

', 'In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be \\nreduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbon \\nsequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be \\nmet solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an \\nindividual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it ', '131 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', ' ', 'may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, would \\nstruggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raises \\nthe question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero and \\nthe extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farms \\nor other sectors. Furthermore, one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as a \\nwhole is to switch from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities (for example, by moving \\nfrom conventional production using artificial fertiliser to organic farming), with a corresponding \\nconsumption switch between agricultural commodities. These criteria and thresholds, which focus \\nspecifically on emissions within the non-perennial crop production activity, cannot address this type of \\nmitigation potential.  ', 'The criteria and thresholds proposed therefore focus on ensuring that emissions are substantially \\nreduced and removals substantially increased at the economic activity (NACE code) level. ', 'There is significant potential to reduce emissions, maintain carbon sinks, and increase sequestration \\nthrough good practices in non-perennial cropland management. Each of these needs to be addressed \\nin order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a \\nnet-zero carbon economy. Doing so will ensure each instance of non-perennial cropland management \\nmaximises its contribution – this rationale drove the principles set out above.  ', 'Approach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activity ', 'There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ \\nha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such \\ninformation existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation, \\nwould remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation.  ', 'However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e/ ha or % change in gCO2e/unit of \\nproduction) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or \\nproject. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a \\nrelatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might \\npreviously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, it \\nis harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in \\nemissions than it is for a farm that currently performs relatively poorly.  Furthermore, to determine \\ncompliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at the farm level is necessary. However, this \\nis not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches.  ', 'The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment \\nof specific bundles of management practices, which are recognised as essential to delivering low \\ncarbon production in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and \\nthere are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly \\ncommunicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the \\nground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well \\nas those that will require additional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of \\nfarms (and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG ', '132 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', ' ', 'footprint. As such, this approach avoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold as \\ndescribed above.  ', 'Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: enteric \\nfermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); and \\nmanure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e) (2014 figures). Mitigation potential therefore \\npredominantly involves reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture \\nemissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only \\n0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU’s agricultural non-\\nCO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous \\noxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application and \\nexposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely \\nfrom livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating, \\ncooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm.  The proposed \\nbest practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than \\n20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy source \\nrequirements.

', 'The manufacturing section of the Taxonomy therefore includes both the manufacturing of low-carbon \\ntechnologies as well as energy intensive and hard-to-abate manufacturing sectors. It aims to give support \\nto those economic activities that are low in carbon emissions and first movers who are engaging in a \\ntransformational shift.  ', 'Manufacturing coverage and thresholds ', 'Which economic activities are included and why ', 'The economic activities covered include sectors that account for a high share of industrial GHG emissions \\nas a result of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions related to the manufacture of the products and therefore \\noffer large potential for GHG emissions reduction. Specifically, this includes: the manufacturing of \\naluminium (NACE 24.42); the manufacturing of iron and steel (NACE 24.1, 24.2, 24.3); the manufacturing \\nof cement (NACE 23.51); and the manufacturing of chemicals (NACE 20.13, 20.14, 20.15, 20.16).  ', 'Additionally, enabling activities are also included in manufacturing which covers both those activities \\nincluded under “low carbon technologies” and also “mitigation measures” which when combined result in \\nachievement of the thresholds.  ', '•  Low carbon activities  refers to: the manufacturing of products, key components, equipment and ', 'machinery that are essential to a number of key renewable energy technologies (geothermal power, \\nhydropower, concentrated solar power (CSP), solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, wind energy and \\nocean energy); the manufacturing of low-carbon transport vehicles, fleets and vessels; the \\nmanufacturing of energy efficiency equipment for buildings and other low-carbon technologies that \\nresult in substantial GHG emission reductions in further sectors of the economy (including private \\nhouseholds).  ', '•  Mitigation measures are included as enabling activities since they are recognised as critical steps \\nsupporting the transition of economic activities in these high emitting manufacturing sectors towards \\nreaching the defined thresholds.  ', 'The TEG acknowledges that many manufacturing activities are still not currently covered in the \\nTaxonomy, and this must be addressed. It should be stated, however, that the TEG have not assumed \\nthat omitted activities are non-green or brown. Due to limited time, the TEG has focused its attention on \\nthose economic activities likely to play the biggest role in leading Europe down a low-carbon pathway to \\nmeet its Paris Agreement and 2050 climate neutrality goals. Therefore, the first round of sectors included \\nin the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy are either those energy intensive and hard-to-abate sectors \\nthat emit the most greenhouse gas emissions or those enabling manufacturing sectors that are clearly \\nnecessary for Europe’s low-carbon economic transformation. This means that other manufacturing \\nsectors (including other energy-intensive sectors) are not currently included even if they are significant in \\ntheir impact.  ', '155 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', ' ', 'Criteria, Metrics and Thresholds ', 'The manufacturing activities addressed in this first draft of the mitigation Taxonomy are considered to \\nmake a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation if the specific thresholds set for each activity \\nare reached (e.g. producing cement with GHG emissions lower than 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement. The criteria \\nfocus instead on reducing the GHG emissions caused by manufacturing activities up to the levels of \\nperformance achieved by best performers. The criteria cover in general both scope 1 and 2 emissions. \\nAdditionally, in a number of sectors, the requirement to limit GHG emissions to the level set in the EU \\nETS benchmarks has been complemented by other thresholds (e.g. on the energy efficiency and carbon \\nintensity of the electricity used) or by alternative qualitative criteria (e.g. making production of recycled \\naluminium eligible).   ', 'The EU ETS benchmarks have been the main reference for setting such thresholds, as they correspond \\nto the level of performance achieved by the 10% best installations in the EU and are updated regularly. \\nThe platform is recommended to review whether additional requirements could be set for those economic \\nactivities where BAT-Associated Energy Efficiency Levels (BAT-AEELs) exist or are developed over time, \\nbased on such levels. The implications of this in terms of global applicability of the Taxonomy will need to \\nbe considered. A regular update is also is needed to assess if alternative low carbon technologies have \\nbecome market ready and commercially available. This may result in alternative threshold criteria for \\nactivities that currently have a threshold based on EU ETS benchmarks. ', ' The thresholds for the manufacturing activities are predominantly tied to EU ETS benchmarks. That \\nmeans that the thresholds reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a \\nparticular sector. EU ETS benchmarks have been selected because they are the most robust \\nbenchmarks available and the data calculated according to the boundaries set are readily available for all \\ninstallations within the EU that are part of the EU ETS scheme. Although performance data using such \\nmetrics are not necessarily readily available for non-EU installations, the methodologies can be followed \\nand therefore can also be calculated univocally for non-EU installations. Additionally, the EU ETS \\nbenchmarks are periodically updated approximately every 5 years, meaning that the thresholds that refer \\nto them will not be static over time but automatically continue to represent the performance of the 10% \\nbest performing plants. ', 'The TEG recognizes that there are disadvantages to using the EU ETS benchmarks. The benchmarks \\nare based on EU historic trends rather than global data. Moreover, EU ETS benchmarks do not consider \\nthe full lifecycle of a process or product but are focused on scope 1 and/or scope 2 GHG emissions. \\nTherefore, EU ETS benchmarks do not directly support recycling or improvement in upstream emissions. \\nMindful of these limitations the TEG has actively looked for equally robust data sources but has to date \\nnot been able to identify equally robust data sources. Where equally robust data can be provided \\nthese should be considered by the Platform.

This means that measures are eligible once \\nthey are implemented entirely and the threshold is reached, as well as if individual investments in \\ndifferent measures are implemented over a defined time span as part of an overall investment \\nplan (e.g. 5 or 10 years) and substantially support the activity achieving the thresholds. ', 'Application of CCS in the Manufacturing Sector  ', 'In the manufacturing sector, certain processes are difficult to reduce to very low carbon levels, particularly \\nin the metals, minerals and chemical sectors. In those cases, switching to renewable energy sources and \\nenergy efficient measures are not feasible options and very low carbon levels may only be achieved by \\neither implementing an alternative manufacturing process, like switching to the production of alternative \\nproducts, or due to the introduction of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which are \\naddressed in another section of the Taxonomy. Additionally, if CCS enables an economic activity in the \\nmanufacturing sector to meet its screening criteria, the installation of CCS technology can be considered \\nTaxonomy eligible once the screening criteria has been met. This also applies to overall economic \\nactivity. Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), where the captured CO2 is utilized as a feed stock (e.g. for \\na chemical process), may also qualify, if substantial mitigation impacts can be demonstrated by reducing \\nemissions towards meeting the activity criteria (e.g. the use of CO2 for enhanced oil extraction would not \\nqualify). ', 'Coherence with other sections of the Taxonomy ', 'Due to the nature of manufacturing, and in order to undertake a proper systemic value chain approach in \\nthe Taxonomy, close linkages have been made with the energy, transport, agriculture and building \\nsectors. Where possible, circularity considerations (in so far as they affect GHG emissions) and a broader \\nvalue chain approach have been considered. Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supply chains, \\nthe future Platform will need to review the thresholds to assess whether changes will be necessary to \\naccommodate the planned circular economy objectives of the Taxonomy. i.e.it is recommended that at \\nthe point in time when the Platform work to define threshold criteria for meeting substantial circular \\neconomy contributions the manufacturing thresholds currently defined with regard to mitigation and \\nadaptation objectives are reviewed.

What follows is an overview of how the TEG subgroup \\nhas worked to respond to the Call for Feedback to get feedback on the publications.  ', '1. The most contentious aspect in manufacturing in terms of the highest number of disagreements was in \\nrelation to the list of low carbon technologies list. Most of the submissions, many of them identical, were \\nrequesting additional technologies to be included in the list.

Stakeholder expressed concerns about the stringency of the thresholds for the manufacture of \\nhydrogen given the need for green hydrogen to contribute to a 2050 zero future. As a result of feedback, \\nthe thresholds were amended.  ', '3. There were multiple requests for a life-cycle analysis of steel to be taken into account in thresholds \\nproposed to acknowledge that steel is a material that can fully be recycled and will continue to play a role \\nin a low carbon economy. We acknowledge the role that steel may play in the supply chain efficiencies, \\nbut for practical reasons have limited the scope of  thresholds proposed to the production of primary steel \\nand steel recycling only. At this stage, circular economy criteria for steel are not proposed and need to be \\ndeveloped in a later stage. In this respect, the manufacturing of e.g. aluminium or cement is dealt with in \\na similar way. ', '4. It was noted that there many of the submission relating to different manufacturing activities, including \\ncement were not purely of  technical nature but were rather presented as  a position. The TEG has \\nworked to ensure that the thresholds applied  promote low carbon production.  ', '5. There was some considerable concern from stakeholders about the manufacture of plastics, \\nparticularly single source plastic production. Many of the submissions recommended a circular economic \\nperspective be introduced. In response, the threshold has become more explicit in limiting eligibility to \\nthose plastic manufactures where at least 90% of the final plastic is not used for single use consumer \\nproducts and is not recycled. This needs to be confirmed needs to be confirmed from science-based \\nresearch/studies etc.  ', 'Next steps and recommendations  ', '1. The TEG recognizes that the scope of the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy should be extended \\nto cover more manufacturing activities. Care must continue to be taken to review the context in which the \\nTaxonomy is applied to ensure that it does not identify activities as green which have perverse incentives \\nor a negative impact on other environmental objectives. From a manufacturing perspective, the TEG ', '196 See, https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/sustainable-finance-teg-taxonomy_en.   ', ' ', '158 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', 'recommends that in the next round the future platform consider building on the work undertaken to \\nestablish thresholds for other manufacturing sectors that include at least in the near-term: ', '•  Further analysis of high polluting activities such as glass manufacturing, paper and pulp ', 'manufacturing, and textiles. The manufacturing processes for these activities are complex, multiple \\nand result in the production of an array of diverse products. The TEG recommends that the future \\nplatform address these manufacturing sectors, by prioritising those processes that contribute the \\nmost significant portion of emissions (e.g. steam generation in the paper and pulp sector) and work to \\nestablish thresholds for these specific processes.  ', '•  Mining: this is an important sector both in terms of avoiding bottlenecks in the deployment of low-', 'carbon technologies by providing the critical materials needed for low-carbon technologies, as well as \\nthe value chain link with energy-intensive manufacturing sectors. Unfortunately, the TEG was not able \\nto complete work for this sector due to time constraints and the complexity of the issues The TEG \\nrecommends that the platform analyse the role the sector plays in terms of enhancing availability of \\nthe critical materials needed for current and future technologies to create a climate neutral, circular \\nand resource efficient economy, while sourcing raw materials in a sustainable and responsible way, \\nwith a view to consider the enabling potential of the sector. The platform is recommended to ensure \\nthat  a life cycle approach is applied when assessing the different phases of the value chain  for \\nmining is applied. The rational for applying life cycle analysis is that many metals are essential for \\nlow-carbon technologies. For example, Aluminium for lightweight cars; Copper for electrics and \\nmotors in electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines; Battery metals (Cobalt, Lead, Lithium, \\nManganese, and Nickel) for clean mobility and grid storage batteries; Zinc and Cobalt for protecting \\noff-shore wind turbines; Silicon in solar panels; Precious metals for clean mobility and solar panels.  ', '•  Further analysis for light manufacturing sectors may also need to be considered by the platform \\nas these sectors grow in impact. For these, the platform could either try to develop individual activity \\ncriteria for each (where feasible) or identify key improvement measures applicable across a number \\nof these sectors and classify them as individual enabling activities. ', '2. Further criteria under DNSH could be analysed particular in regard to the following issues:  ', '•  Red Mud: A waste by product of the process for producing al oxide from the bauxite ore for ', 'aluminium, referred to as red mud contains toxic heavy metals and its high alkalinity makes it \\ncorrosive and damaging to soil and life forms, presenting potentially substantial impacts  when \\ndisposed. Toxic dumps and settling pools are a feature alongside all bauxite/alumina plants \\nworldwide, including across Europe, Russia, China, Guinea, Brazil, Jamaica and Australia. The global \\naverage of bauxite residue generated per tonne of alumina is between 1 and 1.5 tonnes; it is \\nestimated that over 150 million tonnes of bauxite residue are produced annually – 5-6 million tonnes \\nin Europe alone, and the majority of this waste is being landfilled. The platform is recommended to \\nconsider the impacts of red mud under minimum social and health safeguards and develop an \\napproach to set up criteria to integrate this within the DNSH environmental impact. ', '•  The platform is recommended to carry out a risk-based assessment on the exposure scenarios ', 'for all chemicals/products/by-products contained in the taxonomy.  It is to be noted that other \\norganic and inorganic chemicals/products/by-products included in the taxonomy are also potentially \\nhazardous to human health and the environment depending upon the exposure scenarios, and \\ntherefore  objective, scientifically robust,  risk-based assessments should be carried out for all. ', '159 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', 'Furthermore, the platform should take into consideration the value chain and circular economy \\naspects of chemicals/products/by-products.  For example, Chlorine and PVC are required for the \\nproduction of PVC doors and windows, which are necessary for improved energy efficiency of the \\nbuilding sector.  Such value chain and CE considerations would follow a similar logic applied to soda-\\nash in the current version of the Taxonomy, on the basis that it is required for glazing of double and \\ntriple glazed windows. ', '3. The platform is recommended to regularly update the thresholds paying particular attention to: ', '•  Ensuring that the thresholds are updated in the light of EU ETS benchmark revisions.  ', '•  Review the thresholds in the light of circular economy objectives and takes into consideration the ', 'impact of applying an additional requirement that for those economic activities where  BAT-\\nAssociated Energy Efficiency Levels (BAT-AEELs) exist, these must also be met.

Enhance existing thresholds to account for different applications of cement.  ', '•  The platform is recommended to consider developing specific thresholds for different applications of ', 'cement, e.g. concrete for specific building applications.  The focus should be on the substitution of \\nclinker by binders with a lower content of embedded CO2. Cement is currently produced in many \\ndifferent qualities, which are sometimes used in different applications. As a result exchange between \\ntwo qualities is not always possible. Therefore, on the way to a climate-neutral economy, it has to be \\ndetermined which types of cement in which application areas can be replaced by those with a \\nreduced clinker content, taking into account the availability of clinker substitutes. Within the \\ndecarbonisation of other industries, it may be possible that material flows used today (e.g. fly ash) will \\nno longer be available in the future as a clinker substitute, while the suitability of other materials has \\nnot yet been proven.  The cement types, which are absolutely necessary in a climate-neutral \\neconomy and cannot be replaced, must be produced in a climate-friendly way. For these types, it \\nthen should be examined to what extent the clinker ratio can be lowered, how energy efficiency can \\nbe increased, how electricity from renewable energies can be used, etc.  ', '6.

These \\nhighlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled, the reliance of some \\nindividual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste, and the risk that further increasing \\ncapacities risk overcapacity and could result in lock-in effects. This would in turn discourage more reuse \\nand recycling, options higher in the waste hierarchy that could deliver higher climate mitigation benefits. \\nOn the other hand, it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasingly circular \\neconomy, as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled (as acknowledged by the EC in its \\nCommunication COM(2017)34 on ‘the role of waste-to-energy in the circular economy’, Section 5). \\nAccording to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity leading to a significant \\nincrease in the incineration (including WtE) of waste is not considered an eligible activity, as it causes \\nharm to the environmental objective of the circular economy, as per Article 12(d) of the EU Taxonomy \\nregulation, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste. This exception was \\nnot part of the Commission’s proposal, which considered any significant increase of incineration capacity \\nharmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible. Therefore, the TEG has not included WtE, but \\nrecommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on Sustainable \\nFinance, in light of the changes in the political agreement text. \\n ', 'TEG deliberations on nuclear energy ', 'The TEG assessed nuclear energy as part of its review on energy generation activities.

WATER, SEWERAGE, WASTE AND REMEDIATION  ', 'Why is water, sewerage, waste and remediation included in the Taxonomy ', 'The sub-sector Water, Sewerage, Waste and Remediation (WSWR) covering NACE-Codes E36 to E39 \\ncontributes to a rather small share of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions – water with 0.2% and \\nsewerage, waste, remediation with 4.4% in 2016. However, advanced solid waste management has a \\ngreat potential to trigger greenhouse gas emission reductions in other sectors of the economy through \\nwaste prevention, separate waste collection, waste reuse and recycling. ', 'What is covered ', 'In the waste sector, a systems approach describing the climate mitigation effects of an integrated \\npackage of closely interrelated and combined environmentally sustainable activities would have its merits. \\nAs, however, the scope of the Taxonomy subgroup was to define stand-alone activities, the chosen \\nclimate mitigation principles, metrics and thresholds were formulated in a way to allow for the assessment \\nof singular activities without consideration of their linkages in a complex waste management system \\n(respectively, waste hierarchy). ', 'The TEG and the experts involved assessed the NACE codes for WSWR and identified nine economic \\nactivities that offer a substantial contribution for climate mitigation: ', '•  E36.0.0 Water collection, treatment and supply: 1. Water collection, treatment and supply ', '•  E37.0.0 Sewerage: 2. Centralized wastewater treatment; 3. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge  ', '•  E38.1.1 Collection of non-hazardous waste: 4.

Carbon Capture and Storage ', 'NACE Codes ‘E38.1.2 collection of hazardous waste’, ‘E38.2.2 treatment and disposal of hazardous \\nwaste’ and ‘E38.3.1 dismantling of wrecks’ (e.g. automobiles, ships, etc.) were found to be of less \\nrelevance from a climate mitigation perspective and thus reprioritized for later consideration by the \\nPlatform on Sustainable Finance (see section on ‘next steps’ further below). ', '287 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', 'On waste incineration with energy recovery (waste-to-energy, WtE) experts’ opinions differed on whether \\nthis would be an appropriate environmentally sustainable activity offering a substantial contribution to \\nclimate mitigation. On the one hand, there were arguments against the inclusion of WtE. These \\nhighlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled, the reliance of some \\nindividual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste, and the risk that further increasing \\ncapacities risk overcapacity and could result in lock-in effects. This would in turn discourage more reuse \\nand recycling, options higher in the waste hierarchy and that can deliver higher climate mitigation \\nbenefits. On the other hand, it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasingly \\ncircular economy as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled (as acknowledged by the EC in its \\nCommunication COM(2017)34 on ‘the role of waste-to-energy in the circular economy’, Section 5). \\nAccording to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity leading to a significant \\nincrease in the incineration, including WtE, of waste is not considered an eligible activity as it causes \\nharm to the environmental objectives of the circular economy as per Article 12(d) of the EU Taxonomy \\nregulation, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste. This exception was \\nnot part of the Commission’s proposal, which considered any significant increase of incineration capacity \\nharmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible. Therefore, the TEG has not included WtE, but \\nrecommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on Sustainable \\nFinance, in light of the changes in the political agreement text.  ', 'TEG Call for Public Feedback on its Report on EU Taxonomy, June 2019 ', 'The main issues raised in the public feedback on activities in the subsector WSWR related to broadening \\nthe scope of some activities: For ‘anaerobic digestion of bio-waste’, and similar for ‘anaerobic digestion of \\nsewage sludge’ and ‘landfill gas capture and utilization’, respondents suggested to allow for additional \\nuses of the produced biogas or landfill gas. For the ‘anaerobic digestion of bio-waste’, respondents \\nwarned against the exclusion of certain crops and against the exclusion of blending of feedstocks. Both \\nissues are reflected in the revised criteria.  ', 'Setting criteria and thresholds ', 'An important characteristic of subsector WSWR is that for the identified activities – with the exception of \\n‘water collection, treatment and supply’ – the climate mitigation effect is an inherent result of key \\ncharacteristic of the corresponding business model, for example the energetic utilization of bio-gas \\nproduced through the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and bio-waste, or the material recovery from \\nwaste for reuse or recycling in other sectors. Hence, the choice of climate mitigation criteria mainly \\nfocuses on (qualitative) metrics that seek to securing the execution of the activities/businesses \\nthemselves.  ', 'Only in ‘water collection, treatment and supply’ – namely water supply – the climate mitigation effect is the \\nresult of a more efficient design of the production process (e.g. by raising pump efficiency or reducing \\nleakages). Consequently, concrete quantitative thresholds were defined, with a first option describing an \\nambitious level of high energy efficiency in the water collection, treatment and supply system, and with a \\nsecond option setting thresholds for the substantial improvement of the system’s energy efficiency.  ', 'Given the heterogeneity of WSWR, it is challenging to establish a set of one size fits all criteria. This point \\nwas raised in the public consultation feedback. However, it is the view of the TEG that these criteria – \\neven if some are referencing to EU regulation – are globally relevant for the contribution of WSWR to a ', '288 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', 'low carbon economy and with the in-built flexibility on options for demonstrating compliance, they can be \\napplied globally. ', 'Impact of these proposals ', 'The activities do not impose major additional implementation costs on the stakeholders because (as \\nexplained) for most of them – except ‘water collection, treatment and supply’ – the climate mitigation \\neffects are an inherent result of key characteristics of the correspondent business models and thus \\nshould come along without significant further cost. Considering ‘water collection, treatment and supply’, \\nadditional investments may be necessary in order to reach certain thresholds, however the corresponding \\ncosts may partially be equalized by cost savings from higher energy efficiency. ', 'There should be no systematic distortive effect of the activities on the number and competitive position of \\nthe companies in the corresponding sectors. The overall sectoral technological impact will depend on the \\nstate of the water, wastewater and waste management in each Member State in terms of e.g. regional \\ncoverage of different management technologies. Outside of the EU the technological impact could be \\neven greater if the state of the sector in an individual country or region is below that of the EU. ', 'Clear additional beneficial environmental effects can be assumed for e.g. water, circular economy and \\npollution. Employment effects should be positive, and further beneficial economic impacts are induced \\nthrough increased investments and the demand for consumer goods. ', 'Why carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is included in the Taxonomy ', 'Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a key technology for the decarbonisation of Europe. It is \\nincluded in all pathways presented by the European Commission in its Long-Term Strategic Vision \\ndocument and is relied upon heavily in three-out-of-four scenarios outlined by the IPCC in the Special \\nReport on 1.5 Degrees. ', 'A  typical  CCS  chain  consists  of  three  main  stages:  capture,  transport  and  storage.  CO2  transport  and \\nstorage are established and proven processes, with decades of operation and well-established regulation \\nhere in Europe.   ', 'The Technical Expert Group has developed criteria to define the eligibility of facilities used to capture carbon \\ndioxide directly from the atmosphere and, separately, to capture carbon dioxide directly from anthropogenic \\nactivities. ', 'CCS can be eligible in any sector/activity if it enables that primary activity to operate in compliance with the \\nthreshold - for example, steel, cement or electricity production.  ', ' \\nCapture ', ' \\nCCS facilitates the direct mitigation of both fossil and process emissions in many industrial sectors including \\nsteel,  cement  and  chemicals.  Time  is  a  crucial  factor:  the  later  options  for  deep  decarbonisation  in  an \\nindustry arise, the more costly they become, and the more likely the need for greater carbon dioxide removal ', '289 ', '\\x0c ', ' ', '(CDR) in the future. 2050 is only one investment cycle away for many industries. Thus, decisions need to \\nbe made today. ', 'In addition to renewable energies, energy storage and demand-side management, CCS on dispatchable \\ngeneration allows all aspects of the electricity supply system to be deeply decarbonised.284 CCS provides \\na backstop to the unabated operation of flexible electricity generation plants that are required to guarantee \\nthe operation and supply of year-round electricity. This is especially true in more isolated grids with a high \\npenetration of seasonally variable renewables (e.g. onshore and offshore wind) where the reliable operation \\nof electricity networks requires on-demand electricity generation.  ', 'The availability of CCS means that no remaining segment of the electricity supply system will be capable \\nof emitting CO2 to the atmosphere. ', 'Whilst some CO2 capture technologies can incur an ‘energy penalty’ of 10-15%, others do not. For example, \\nthe Allam cycle being developed by Net Power on natural gas combustion for power generation does not \\nincur  an  energy  penalty,  as  supercritical  CO2  is  integrated  fully  into  the  power  cycle  as  a  coolant.  This \\nsignificantly reduces both energy and water demand. It is therefore inaccurate to say that CCS is a highly \\nenergy-intensive technology. ', 'Transport and Storage  ', 'The  transport  and  storage  of  CO2  should  be  considered  essential  to  the  infrastructure  of  a  modern, \\nsustainable  society.  It  can  aid  electricity  grid  expansion,  the  integration  of  renewables  and  the  deep \\ndecarbonisation of energy intensive industries; support and enable CO2 removal; and help stimulate a green \\nhydrogen  market.

CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES ', 'Preamble ', 'In the  EU,  buildings  are  effectively  the largest  energy  consuming  sector,  responsible for  around  40%  of \\nenergy consumption and 36% of carbon emissions.407 At the same time, embodied carbon emissions are \\nincreasing  and  receiving  growing  attention.

', '•  The inherent difficulty of creating a level playing field across countries with different climates and \\ndegrees of market readiness. Compared to other economic  activities,  the  operation  of individual \\nbuildings has unique characteristics, which means the performance of different assets cannot easily \\nbe  compared.  Due  to  climatic  differences  across  regions,  buildings  in  different  locations  have \\ndifferent energy needs for heating, air conditioning and lighting, and therefore different potential to \\ncontribute to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, the nature of the existing building stock varies \\nsignificantly from country to country, and even from region to region, due to differences in design, \\nconstruction techniques and building age. ', '•  The desire to find a compromise between rising ambition and building upon already existing ‘green’ \\nfinancing  instruments.  The  financing  of  buildings  and  building  energy  improvements  is  the  most \\ndeveloped segment of the green finance market, and  the ownership of buildings in portfolios is an \\nextensively practiced economic activity. As the Taxonomy is introduced to the market, it is important \\nto maintain the volume of existing investors and enable them to use the Taxonomy to evaluate their \\nportfolios.

FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES  ', 'Background ', 'According to the World Economic Forum Report (2020), more common extreme weather events could \\nmake insurance unaffordable or simply unavailable for individuals and businesses.  Globally, the \\n‘catastrophe protection gap’ - what should be insured but is not – reached US$280 billion (EUR€252 \\nbillion) in 2018596.  The TEG is concerned to address the widening protection gap by classifying \\nselected non-life insurance lines of business (LOBs) as substantially contributing to ‘adaptation by’.  \\nThe eligible economic activity substantially contributes to ‘adaptation by’ when it meets Principle B1.1 \\nwhereby: ', '“the activity reduces or facilitates adaptation to physical climate risks beyond the boundaries of the \\nactivity itself. This includes activities that: ', 'a) Promote a new technology, product, practice or governance process or innovative uses of existing \\npractices (including those related to natural infrastructure); or, ', 'b) Remove information, financial, technological and capacity barriers to adaptation by others.” ', 'Non-life insurance eligible for the Taxonomy includes selected LOBs and insurance products and \\nservices that provide cover for climate-related hazards to activities and/or assets that are Taxonomy \\naligned.   ', 'As the number and range of sub-sectors eligible for the Taxonomy evolves arising from development \\nof substantial contribution to the remaining four environmental objectives, additional activities will \\nbecome eligible for Taxonomy aligned non-life insurance products.  Furthermore, the TEG believes \\nthat economic activities that may not be screened for substantial contribution to any of the six \\nenvironmental objectives, such as environmentally neutral activities (schools, hospitals, public \\nadministration services, etc.), which may nonetheless be impacted by climate change should be \\nconsidered as potentially eligible for Taxonomy aligned non-life insurance. TEG recommends further \\nconsideration of DNSH criteria for non-life insurance activities to enhance the coverage of activities \\nand improve usability of the criteria.
